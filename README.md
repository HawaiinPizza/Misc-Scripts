# Just Some Scripts
Just some miscellaneous scripts I made that can help out in day to day life.

Current stuff:
## Vim
Spellchecker: Toggle with a keybinding, and you can cycle through spelling.

## Taskwarrior to Calcurse Sync
One thing I hate about taskwarrior is the calendar. I made this script to export taskwarrior to calcurse. Issue is it takes 2.20 seconds to run, and require alot of exterinal programs:
- csvkit: Program for maniplating csv
- GNU version of sed: I haven't tested to see if this openbsd compatiable or not.
