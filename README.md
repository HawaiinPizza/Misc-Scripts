# Just Some Scripts
Just some miscellaneous scripts I made that can help out in day to day life.

Current stuff:
## Vim
Spellchecker: Toggle with a keybinding, and you can cycle through spelling.

## Taskwarrior to Calcurse Sync
One thing I hate about taskwarrior is the calendar. I made this script to export taskwarrior to calcurse. The problem is it requires a custom version of taskwarrior's export, which is provided.
